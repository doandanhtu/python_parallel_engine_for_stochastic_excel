# Scenarios and Policies can be specified as:
# - Specific list: [1, 2, 3, 5]

# Example: policies: "all"  # Run all policies from CSV
# Example: policies: "200:300"  # Run policies 200-300 inclusive
# Example: policies: [1, "10:20", 50]  # Run 1, 10-20, and 50

# Worker timeout (seconds) for detecting stuck workers
# Set this based on n_sims: rough estimate is 1-2 seconds per simulation
# For 1000 sims, use at least 1500-2000 seconds (25-33 minutes)
# For 100 sims, use at least 200 seconds (3+ minutes)

# Provisioning options for per-worker model copies
# Worker models are stored in `worker_models_dir` (project root level, persistent).
# If `n_workers` is omitted here, the top-level `n_workers` is used.
provision:
  enabled: true     # set true to provision before running
  force: true       # set true to overwrite existing files
  clean: true       # set true to remove all worker models before copying
  # n_workers: 20    # optional override; defaults to top-level n_workers
 
# Worksheet and ranges used in the model (centralized here so changes to model layout are easy)
